Does Shopify allow custom coding?

The customization primarily revolves around the theme, where HTML, Liquid, CSS, and JavaScript can be modified to create a unique storefront with personalized design and functionality.

Is Shopify development free?

While Shopify provides a 14-day free trial, it is not entirely free for ongoing use. Shopify operates on a subscription model, and users must choose a pricing plan based on their business requirements. The subscription covers the hosting, security, and basic functionalities of the online store. Additionally, there might be costs associated with third-party apps and custom developments.

The choice between Shopify and WordPress depends on the specific needs of the business. Shopify is e-commerce solution, offering simplicity and ease of use. It is well-suited for users who want a hassle-free experience and don't want to manage hosting separately. On the other hand, WordPress, especially when paired with the WooCommerce plugin, provides more flexibility and control. WordPress is often favored for content-heavy websites, blogs, and businesses looking for a versatile platform that extends beyond e-commerce.
