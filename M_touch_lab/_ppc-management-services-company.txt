Frequently Asked Questions
 
What is Google Ads?

Google Ads is an online advertising platform developed by Google. It allows businesses to create and run ads that appear on Google's search engine results pages . Google Ads operates on a pay-per-click (PPC) model, where advertisers bid on keywords and pay for each click on their ads.

What is PPC Marketing?

PPC (Pay-Per-Click) marketing is a form of online advertising where advertisers pay each time their ad is clicked. It is a model used by search engines like Google, Bing, and social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. In PPC marketing, advertisers bid on specific keywords relevant to their target audience, and their ads are displayed to users who search for those keywords or visit websites related to them. PPC campaigns are highly customizable and offer precise targeting options, making them an effective way to reach potential customers and drive conversions.

Why do you need PPC services?

PPC (Pay-Per-Click) services are essential for businesses seeking to maximize their online visibility and achieve specific marketing objectives. Firstly, PPC services offer immediate results, unlike organic methods like SEO which can take time to gain traction. With PPC, businesses can launch campaigns and start generating traffic and leads almost instantly. Additionally, PPC provides precise targeting options, allowing businesses to reach their ideal audience based on factors like demographics, interests, and keywords.

How does the Google AdWords auction work?

Google AdWords auction is the process by which Google determines which ads to display on its search engine results page.

 

Ad Rank Calculation: Google calculates an Ad Rank for each ad based on its maximum bid and Quality Score. Ad Rank determines the position of the ad on the SERP.

 

Maximum Bid: Advertisers set a maximum bid for each keyword they target. This is the maximum amount they are willing to pay for a click on their ad.

 

Quality Score: Quality Score is a metric used by Google to measure the relevance and quality of an ad and its landing page. It is determined based on factors like click-through rate (CTR), ad relevance, and landing page experience.

What is the difference between SEO and PPC?

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and PPC (Pay-Per-Click) are two distinct digital marketing strategies used to increase a website's visibility in search engine results . SEO focuses on optimizing a website's content, structure, and authority to improve its organic (unpaid) ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs). IPPC is a form of online advertising where advertisers pay a fee each time their ad is clicked. PPC ads are displayed prominently on search engine results pages and other online platforms, usually above or below organic search results.
