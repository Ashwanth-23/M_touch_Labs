Frequently Asked Questions
 
What is Node.js?

A cross-platform, open-source JavaScript environment called Node.js is made to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It permits programmers to create scalable and high-performing network applications by utilising JavaScript . Because of its architecture, Node.js is particularly useful for developing real-time applications, web servers, APIs, and other networked software.

What is the key feature of Node.js?

Here are key feature that contribute to its widespread adoption and effectiveness:

 

Non-blocking I/O

Node.js uses a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, allowing it to efficiently handle a large number of concurrent connections. This makes it well-suited for applications with real-time features.

Is NodeJS good for Web Development?

Most people agree that Node.js is a great option for web development. Building scalable and high-performing server-side applications is one area in which it excels. Because of its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, Node.js can effectively manage a high number of concurrent connections.

Can Node.js be used for building APIs?

Node.js is highly suitable for building APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Its event-driven, non-blocking architecture and support for asynchronous operations make it particularly well-suited for handling the demands of API development.

What is the difference between Node.js and JavaScript?

The main difference between Node.js and JavaScript lies in their respective environments and applications. JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily utilized for client-side scripting within web browsers. It enables developers to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces, making websites more engaging for users. Traditionally, JavaScript was confined to the frontend domain.

 

On the other hand, Node.js extends the utility of JavaScript to the server-side. It is a runtime environment that facilitates the execution of JavaScript code outside of the browser, allowing developers to build scalable and efficient server-side applications.

 

Node.js includes the V8 JavaScript engine, originally developed for Google Chrome, and adds features that support server-side development. This extension of JavaScript functionality to the server side enables a unified language and codebase for full-stack development, where JavaScript is employed for both frontend and backend tasks, creating a more cohesive and streamlined development process.
