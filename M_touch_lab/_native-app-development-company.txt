What is Native Language in App Development?

In app development, the term "native language" refers to the programming language specifically designed for a particular platform or operating system.

Using the native language ensures optimal performance and seamless integration with the features and capabilities of the targeted platform.

What is an Example of a Native App?

What is the Difference Between Native App Development and Cross-Platform?

Which Programming Language is used for developing Native ios apps?

For developing native iOS apps, Apple provides the Swift programming language. Swift was introduced by Apple in 2014 as a modern, fast, and safe programming language specifically designed for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS development. Prior to Swift, Objective-C was the primary language for iOS app development.

Swift offers several advantages, including readability, syntax clarity, and improved performance compared to Objective-C. It has quickly become the preferred language for many iOS developers.
