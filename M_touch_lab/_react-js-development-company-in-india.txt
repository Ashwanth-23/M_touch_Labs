Frequently Asked Questions
 
What is React.js and why is it popular?

React.js, which is often called React, is a JavaScript library that's freely available, for creating user interfaces. It was created by Facebook and has gained popularity among developers for reasons;

 

Virtual DOM: React utilizes a DOM to enhance performance by selectively updating only the parts of the real DOM that have been modified rather than re-rendering the entire DOM.

 

Component-based architecture: The component based architecture of React enables developers to create modular UI components resulting in efficient development processes.

 

Declarative syntax: React utilizes a declarative syntax, making it easier to understand and maintain code compared to traditional imperative approaches.

What are the key features of React.js?

JSX (JavaScript XML): JSX allows developers to write HTML-like syntax directly within JavaScript code, making it easier to create and manipulate UI elements.

 

Component-based architecture: React applications are composed of reusable and independent components, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

 

Virtual DOM: React's virtual DOM efficiently updates the UI by minimizing DOM manipulation, resulting in improved performance.

 

Unidirectional data flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow, ensuring predictable state management and easier debugging.

What are React.js Hooks and how do they work?

React Hooks are functions that enable developers to use state and other React features in functional components, which were previously only available in class components. Some commonly used React Hooks include:

 

useState(): Allows functional components to use state.

useEffect(): Performs side effects in functional components, such as data fetching or DOM manipulation.

useContext(): Accesses context in functional components.

useReducer(): Manages state with a reducer function in functional components.

useRef(): Creates a mutable reference in functional components.

What is JSX in React.js? How is it different from HTML?

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript code. JSX is used in React.js to describe what the UI should look like. Some differences between JSX and HTML include:

 

Attribute naming: In JSX, attributes use camelCase naming convention (e.g., className instead of class).

 

Expression interpolation: JSX allows embedding JavaScript expressions within curly braces {} to dynamically render content.

 

Custom components: JSX allows developers to define and use custom components similar to HTML elements.

What are the main differences between React.js and other JavaScript frameworks ?

React.js, Angular, and Vue.js are popular JavaScript frameworks/libraries used for building user interfaces, but they differ in several aspects:

 

Component-based vs. MVVM architecture: React.js follows a component-based architecture, while Angular follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, and Vue.js follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

 

Rendering approach: React.js uses a virtual DOM for efficient updates, Angular uses two-way data binding, and Vue.js uses a virtual DOM similar to React but also supports two-way data binding.

 

Learning curve: React.js has a relatively shallow learning curve compared to Angular, which has a steeper learning curve due to its extensive feature set, and Vue.js, which is known for its simplicity and ease of adoption.
